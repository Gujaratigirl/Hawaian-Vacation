# SqlAlchemy-Challenge

## Planning a trip to Hawaii!   

Great you have come to the right place- Pick Your Vacation Date!  
We are here to help with all of you Temperature and Rain data needs.  

Started out with an sqlite file and reflected it to see it contained 2 tables 'measurement', 'station'.
Further investigated and was able to find out the table content and print it into Jupyter Notebook to help formulate the analysis plan.

Assignment asked for the last years data.    
#1 - Find out the last date of collected data- [(2724, 'USC00519397', '2017-08-23')].     
#2 - Used this to create a filter to query the last year of data.     
#3 - Put the data into a DataFrame and the plotted it.   
#4 - Bar Plot shows there is more rain in Sept, April and Feb from the data set that was analyzed.    
#5 - Bar Plot for Temperature shows 80+ degrees in fairly consistently in July and August.     
#6 - Histogram shows temperatures are bell curved in the range of 65 to 80 degrees.  These are great temperatures for a vacation!

I would say from the data available - GO on a vacation to Hawaii in July or August to get the high temps and lower chances of rain to spoil your vacation!      

Enjoy!
